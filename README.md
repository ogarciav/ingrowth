## *R* software for ingrowth imputation

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of *ingrowth* is to perform imputation for trees not measured due to a
  minimum size threshold in even-aged forest permanent sample plots.
  The *R* mini-package contains a single function, `ingrowth()`, in addition to
  documentation and test data.
  
### Installation

You can install the package like so:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ogarciav/ingrowth")
```
Alternatively, you can simply download just the main function *R/ingrowth.R*.
